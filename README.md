# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) apllied to a set of galaxies images

## Whats is PCA?

PCA is a method to represent and store huge amounts of data using what is called dimensionality reduction. You can think of it as a generalization of the linear regression: you have points in a a 2 dimensional points, each one with a x and y coordinate; when we apply linear regression to these points, a line representing the direction with more variance is drawn. Finally, you'll have a tendency line that represnt all the points sparsed in the 2D space into a single dimensional: if you specify an argument to the line, the line will give you the best approximation of the y-value of the point closest to the line.

We can think of this direction of largest variance as produced by a unitary vector whose direction
